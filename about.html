        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a junior at UMass Amherst pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
          My interests lie in Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past year, I've worked on projects involving machine learning, front-end development,
          and implementing various algorithms. 
          I'm also passionate about supporting women in tech and currently serve as 
          the Vice President of my university's Girls Who Code chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of building projects, I enjoy dancing, listening to music, and connecting with other developers.
